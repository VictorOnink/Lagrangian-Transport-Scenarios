# General
This directory contains code to create a number of different figures that aren't necessarily scenario specific. The files in this directory are:
- `General_average_wind_speed.py`: This is a figure of the average wind speed over the model domain.
- `General_bathymetry.py`: This is a figure of the model bathymetry.
- `General_input_scenario.py`: This is a basic figure showing the relative input of particles for a given input scenario.
- `General_bathymetry_histogram.py`: Plots a histogram of all the bathymetry depths within a region.
- `General_season_average.py`: Plots the seasonal averaged wind speed and MLD fields.
- `General_distance2coast.py`: Plots the distance to the nearest model coastline for a basin.
- `General_mean_tidal_Kz.py`: Plots the vertical profile of the tidally-driven vertical diffusion coefficient $K_z$
