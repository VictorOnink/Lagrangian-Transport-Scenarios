This directory contains code for visualizing the parcels simulations, and this is divided over the following subdirectories:
- `SizeTransport`: This contains all the code for visualizing the size dependent transport simulations from the `SizeTransport` scenario.
- `General`: This contains a number of common visualizations, such as creating a figure of the basin bathymetry or plotting the input scenario.
- `visualization_utils`: This directory contains a number of utility functions specifically for plotting purposes.
