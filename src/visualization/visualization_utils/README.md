# visualization_utils
This directory contains the `utils_visual.py` file, which contains a number of utility functions for creating visualizations. Examples include a standardized function for creating 
geophraphical map axes using cartopy, creating a discrete step color map and creating an axis object for if we need to create
a figure with multiple subplots.

We also have the `utils_loading_data.py` file, which contains functions for loading post-processed data for the various
scenarios.
